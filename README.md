             Heart attack detector

               Detection of Heart attack by prediction module. The persons heart rate is collected, and the data is continuously monitored by the prediction module. Depending on the heart rate the pre-existing module will alert the doctor, patient and his guardians who are added by the user in case of extreme change in the heartbeat. We are using unsupervised machine learning to separate the data in terms of pulse rate , then linear regression to predict the heart attack .
